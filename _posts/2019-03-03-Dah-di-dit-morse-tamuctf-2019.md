# TAMUctf 2019 - Crypto - -.-

## Chall
To 1337-H4X0R:

Our coworker Bob loves a good classical cipher. Unfortunately, he also loves to send everything encrypted with these ciphers. Can you go ahead and decrypt this for me?

## Solve

This was a pretty simple challenge, searching about the "dah-dit-di's" we can find out that this is a morse code, it is possible to solve with a text editor just replacing the text with slashes or dots, but i made a script in python to do this, you can find in my github:

https://github.com/fernandormoraes/morsereflectedsoundtranslator
(Well, i just haven't figured out a good name for the repo, lmao)

My script will return translated and then we'll have a hex:
